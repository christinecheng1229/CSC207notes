A "stakeholder" is a person whose responsibilities or interests may lead them to request changes to a class in your program.

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that each class should have at most one stakeholder or potential source of change.

When listing **User Stories**, we use a formula that states

> "As a (stakeholder), I ...".
> 

Some stakeholders, sometimes called actors, are listed in your user stories (such as "user") and others are hidden (such as "database administrator").
