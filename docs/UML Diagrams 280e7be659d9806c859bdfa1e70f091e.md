Need to continuously mention methods until they are implemented:

- abstract methods → italicised
- implemented methods → underlined
- inherited methods should not be written again in subclasses
- overloaded & overridden methods should be written in each subclass

Abstract class: `ClassName <<abstract>>`

Interface class: `ClassName <<interface>>`

variables are usually private

methods are not private: i.e., can be public, protected, or package-protected (default)

arrows point towards the more abstract (up inheritance hierarchy) class
