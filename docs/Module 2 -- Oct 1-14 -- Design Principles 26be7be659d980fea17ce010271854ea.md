- **Assess** design based on the SOLID principles.
- **Identify** dependencies and remove them using dependency injection.
- **Develop** user stories for a program and **identify** stakeholders.
- **Create** UML class diagrams to represent the data in a program.
- **Write** API calls to access services provided by external sources.

> We won't explicitly talk about the component-level principles in this course, but Part 4: Component Principles (93–132) is also a useful read as you begin to explore design principles. The reading introduces similar principles to SOLID, but at the scale of a component in a larger system, so it may give you further insights into SOLID as a result.
