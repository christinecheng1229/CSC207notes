- Use case (more useful) is smaller than user stories (broarder)
- a use case can be a part of multiple user stories
- tells the developer what each class should do
- [TODO: insert use case vs user stories comparison]
- exception flows - how to handle issue outside of our program/control, bc we can’t solve the issue
- alternative flows - mistake on the user end/doesn’t follow the ideal usage (main flow) of the program

Main flow format: a series of *very* small steps

should be like a series of points with arrows: user does [] → what the program does

example from alternative flow:

# Activities

- activity 1:
    
    B.
    
    - technically open for interpretation → in real-world, should try to confirm /w client exactly what they want
- activity 2:
    
    scenario 1: B. or C. - up for interpretation :)
    
    scenario 2: B. or C. - up for interpretation :)
    
    suggestion:
    
    - if it’s easy to change tag names later, maybe just use ‘Untitled#’ as a placeholder
    - if it’s difficult to change tag names later, maybe alert user and show error
